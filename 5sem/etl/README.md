Excel and Power BI has a powerful data analysis pack named [Get and Transform](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/about-power-query-in-excel-7104fbee-9e62-4cb9-a02e-5bfb1a6c536a?redirectSourcePath=%252fen-us%252farticle%252fget-transform-in-excel-881c63c6-37c5-4ca2-b616-59e18d75b4de) (*previously known as Power Query*).

It is an ETL pack for cleaning and sorting raw data from a range of input sources, such as CSV and text files.
