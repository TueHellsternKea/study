# Excel and ETL
Excel and Power BI has a powerful data analysis pack named **Get and Transform** (*previously known as Power Query*).

It is an ETL pack for cleaning and sorting raw data from a range of input sources, such as CSV and text files.

In this age of data lakes and petabyte-scale databases, it is shocking how frequently you still receive data in the form of CSV, text, and Excel files.

The day-to-day drudgery of data analysis is still a manual process of finding, compiling, and wrangling disparate data types.
