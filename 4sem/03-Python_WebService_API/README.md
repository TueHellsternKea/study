# API
**What is an API?**

Application Programming Interface (API) is a software middleman that allows two apps to communicate with one another. You use an API every time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone.

## OpenAPI - Specification
The OpenAPI Specification, previously known as the Swagger Specification, is a specification for machine-readable interface files for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services.

Previously part of the Swagger framework, it became a separate project in 2016, overseen by the OpenAPI Initiative, an open-source collaboration project of the Linux Foundation.

## FastAPI
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
