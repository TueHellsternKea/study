# Git
Git is a free and open source **distributed version control system** designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like *Subversion*, *CVS*, *Perforce*, and *ClearCase* with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.
