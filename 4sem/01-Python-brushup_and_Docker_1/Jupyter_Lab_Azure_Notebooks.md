# Jupyter Lab on Azure Notebooks



There are some advantages of running your Jupyter Notebook on Azure as opposed to your local system.

- **Global access** - You can access your notebooks/repositories anywhere in the world as opposed to your local system
- **Elasticity** - You can use a lower compute to run data pre-processing and move to a higher compute when you are training a more complex model or using more data
- **Older Hardware** - Whether you are using the latest laptop, or an old thing from a couple of decades ago, as long as you have a browser you can deploy machine learning models on the Azure cloud
- **Easy to share and collaborate** - With the advantage of pulling and deploying straight from your Github, you can also collaborate and share Jupyter Notebooks
- **The familiarity of Jupyter Notebook** - Jupyter Notebook has been the de facto options for data scientists for some years
