# GitHub <!-- fit -->
Millions of developers and companies build, ship, and maintain their software on GitHubâ€”the largest and most advanced development platform in the world.

*70 to 80% of programmer uses Git for version control and Github repository, both public and private, for storing their source codes*

---

# GitHub
A Programmer should also understand the basic concepts of source control like why and how and also Git fundamentals like local vs. remote commit, pushing change, pull requests, and code review.

## Virtual environments help you to:

- Resolve dependency issues by allowing you to use different versions of a package for different projects. *For example, you could use Package A v2.7 for Project X and Package A v1.3 for Project Y.*
- Make your project self-contained and reproducible by capturing all package dependencies in a requirements file.
- Install packages on a host on which you do not have admin privileges.
- Keep your global site-packages/directory tidy by removing the need to install packages system-wide which you might only need for one project.

---

## Step by Step

2. **Create a new virtual environment**
    - *python3 -m venv venv-name*
3. **Activate the virtual environment**
    - macOS - *source env/bin/activate*
    - Windows - *.\Scripts\activate*
4. **Packages**
    - Install 
        - *pip3 install name*
    - requirements.txt
        - *pip3 install -r requirements.txt*

# Opgave

- Create a new Virtual Environment with the name - **northwind**
- Activate the Virtual Environment
- Create 2 folders inside **northwind**: *data* and *assets*
- Download and place thise 2 files:
    - *data* - northwind_data.xlsx
    - *assets* - Northwind-Logo.gif
- Create and run a **requirements.txt** file with thise packages:
    - *dash*
    - *plotly*
    - *pandas*
    - *openpyxl*
    - *dash_bootstrap_components*

# Dashboard - Dash <!-- fit -->

Dash apps give a point-&-click interface to models written in Python, vastly expanding the notion of what's possible in a traditional "dashboard".

With Dash apps, data scientists and engineers put complex Python analytics in the hands of business decision-makers and operators.

## Make sure that you have:

- MySQL installed as a local server
- MySQL Workbench installed

## Views
A view is a **virtual table** based on a SQL statement.

A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.

You can add SQL statements and functions to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table.

A view is created with the **CREATE VIEW** statement. 

---

##  Stored Procedure
A stored procedure is a **prepared SQL code** that you can save, so the code can be reused over and over again.

You can **pass parameters** to a stored procedure, so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that is passed.

A stored procedure is created with the **CREATE PROCEDURE** statement.
