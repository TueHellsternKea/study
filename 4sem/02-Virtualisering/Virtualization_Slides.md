# What is Cloud computing?

The cloud is sold through **services**

- Referring to some IT technology
- Sold as a product
- Provided by a Service Provider
- Bounded by a SLA (*Service Level Agreement*)
- Abstract - independent from the hardware
- Scalable - easy to expand or reduce (*amount of users, storage, etc.*)
- Accessed via a **browser** or an **API**

---

# Advantages

## Low Cost

- Cheap - *on demand, pay-per-use formula*
- No need of expertise in security, clusters, networks, etc.
- Accessibility
- Multiplatform
- No worries about updates, upgrades, new licenses
- Easy to use / integrate

---

![bg right:35%](https://github.com/officegeek/image/raw/main/Cloud_computing.jpg)
# Disadvantages

## Lack of control

- **Once you go cloud, you cannot come back** – *at least it is very difficult*
- Cannot easily switch cloud technologies
- Legal issues: data policy, storing private data…

## Who has ownership of the data? <!-- fit -->

# IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service

- It offers everything, including the server - Network/Storage/Containers(Docker)
- **Remember** - That you don’t get to own a server, but an instance of it (virtual machine)
- **Constraints** - The VM cannot offer more capabilities than the physical HW

### You think you have the whole server, but actually your VM can travel across servers and run where it wants

# PaaS - Platform as a Service

- Offers a runtime environment
- The client has it’s own web applications and wants to host them (*i.e. a website*)
- Container orchestration (*Docker*)

- The applications are hosted in the cloud and offer a **WEB interface**

# Types of Cloud – types of implementation

**Public cloud** (*Amazon, IBM, Googl, Microsoft Azure*)
- The client and the service provider are different organizations
- The client doesn’t necessarily know where the servers are
- Cheap: no investment, no HW maintenance, pay-per-use

**Private**
- The company owns the data-center
- More expensive: same as not having the cloud
- Still using virtualization

**Hybrid**
- Companies that own servers and also uses some cloud services
- Most common solutions for companies with data centers
    - *I.e. your monitoring solution is in the cloud but you own the data center*

# Virtualization basics

![bg left:60% 100%](https://github.com/officegeek/image/raw/main/wm_2.png)

Virtualization is the practice of breaking down the **physical infrastructure** of computing and networking resources into smaller, reusable and more flexible **software units**.

---

# Reasons why you should use virtualization
- **Server consolidation** – Virtualization can reduce capital investments. In traditional environments it is common to dedicate each server to a single application. Virtualization enables you to consolidate all the workloads on one server, which reduces the number of physical machines
- **Virtual labs** – Run a virtual machine to try out application
- **Security purposes** – Uae Virtual machines for specific purposes
- **Faster server provisioning** – With a virtual machine, you can quickly clone an image, master template, or existing virtual machine to get a server up and running within a few minutes
- **Cost saving** – On the physical server hardware, power and cooling of the servers. Time used to administer physical servers

# Hypervisor

A hypervisor is a program for creating and running virtual machines.

1. **Native** - *Bare metal* hypervisors that run guest virtual machines directly on a system's hardware, essentially behaving as an operating system - *Microsoft Hyper-V, Oracle VM server*
2. **Hosted** hypervisors behave like traditional applications that can be started and stopped like a normal program - *Microsoft Virtual PC, Oracle VirtualBox*
