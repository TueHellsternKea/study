# Exploratory data analysis
In statistics, **Exploratory Data Analysis** (*EDA*) is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods.

A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling and thereby contrasts traditional hypothesis testing.

EDA will give you the basic understanding of your data, it's distribution, null values and much more. You can either explore data using graphs or through some Python functions.

# Example Supermarket sales
We are using a data set from [www.kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales) with historical record of sales data in 3 different supermarkets.

The dataset consists of data from 3 cities or 3 branches in Myanmar:
- Branch A (*Yangoon*)
- Branch B (*Mandalay*)
- Branch C (*Naypyitaw*)
