# Linear Regression in Python

## Regression is?
- Regression analysis is a statistical method for estimating the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables
- Regression techniques are used in all branches of the sciences and finance
- The two main uses of regression are:
    - **Prediction**: Forecast the outcome of an event/state/object from previous knowledge
    - **Inference**: Determine how an event/state/object

# scikit-learn
We will use the module **scikit-learn** to implement linear regression and polynomial regression

Linear regression is the most widely used regression method

f(x) = b_{0} + b_{1}x_{1} + b_{2}x_{2} + ... b_{r}x_{r}

**scikit-learn** is built on top of NumPy


# Salary example
We will be using salary dataset. 

The dataset have 2 columns:

â€“ Years of Experience
- Salary

The dataset is in Excel format.

- [Jupyter Lab Salary File](./data/linear/SalaryData.ipynb)
- [SalaryData.xlsx](./data/linear/SalaryData.xlsx)

# Webshop - Age/Spend - Assignment
